<h1>Name the tags in the snippet</h>
<p>The tag is basically the same as an element. From the snippet that was provided in Github the tags are: is the p & a

<h2>Relationship between the tags in terms of nesting ("X" is a child of "Y"</h2>
<p>In the snipper the a tag is inside the p tag. So that would mean that a is a child of p and p is the parent of a. So it's nested.</p>
<h3>Relatinship between p and a</h3>
<p>You write code between the starting tag and closing tag of p. Since a is inside of the p tag it makes it a child of p.</p>
<h4>List the attriube names on the a tag and its value</h4>
<p>The whole starting tag of a is all one element. Google is what actually goes inside the a tag.The url won't show up. Only the words Google.The href, id, class, and target are all attriibutes to the a tag. The href is for where you want the link to go. It gives the elemeent an id so in css you can target one element. So basically it gives you can id so you can use to refrence the element. Id is for one element. If I wanted to target every element then I would use class. Class can apply to as many elements as you want. For an anchor tag if you use target="_blank" when you click on it instead of putting it in the same tab it will open it in another tab. It has four attributes total in this one a element.  </p>
